Tailwind CSS Course Repository

Welcome
-------
Welcome to the Tailwind CSS course repository! ðŸš€ This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning Tailwind CSS. Each folder corresponds to a specific lecture, covering a spectrum of topics such as margin, padding, font sizes, hover effects, focus states, active states, responsive design, apply directive, layer directive, and more.

Structure
---------
- Every lecture folder contains an `index.html` file, demonstrating the application of Tailwind CSS properties discussed in that lecture.
- Additionally, each folder includes a `NOTES.txt` file where I've documented key insights and takeaways.

Progress and Commitment
-----------------------
I am actively committing to this repository on a daily basis as I progress through the Tailwind CSS course. You can follow my learning journey by exploring the folders.

Getting Started
---------------
For Beginners:
1. Open any lecture folder.
2. Locate the `index.html` file within that folder.
3. Paste the following CDN script in the `<head>` section of the HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
This script ensures that Tailwind CSS is loaded and ready for use. Don't worry about the other files in each folder; the main focus is on the index.html file.

Note on Installation
As you progress and gain more understanding of Tailwind CSS, it's recommended to learn how to install Tailwind in your projects for a more customized setup.

Future Plans
I plan to apply the knowledge gained from this course to real-world projects. Stay tuned for exciting updates and practical applications of Tailwind CSS!
